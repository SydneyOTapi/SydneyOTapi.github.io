<p>I'm a junior at Lehigh University. I'm originally from Maryland, right outside of Washington, D.C. I packed my bags and moved to Bethlehem, PA to study Journalism, Graphic Design, and Global Studies. This semester, I decided to enroll in a Data Visualization course, hoping to combine my love for writing and design in a creative and interdiciplinary structure. I've learned a lot this semester and you can check it out here!</p>

<h3>
<a id="What I've Created" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I've Created</h3>

<p>I had the chance to create a variety of content while mixing written word and unique design solutions. I learned to use popular applications that are taking the Data  Visualization world by storm.</p>
<ul>
<p>// As a woman at Lehigh, I decided to explore how gender percentages are continuing to change. I discovered that the class of 2020 in 55 percent male. To visually communicate the information I used canva to create an <a href="SydneyOTapi.github.io/infographic.html">infographic</a></p>
<p>// I created a <a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/concerts.html"> Chart</a> using ChartBuilder to display the infant mortality rate in the past 10 years through a global lens. I wanted to see how this rate differs within western, developed countries.</p>
<p>I am a news editor for Lehigh's biweekly newspaper,<i>The Brown and White</i>. I questioned the history of the publication, so I constructed a<a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/brownandwhite.html"> timeline</a> with TimelineJS to share its fascinating past. </p>
<p>As a member of the College of Arts and Sciences, I was interested in whether enrollment has increased or decreased within the last few years. I had then made a <a href="https://jessicahicks.github.io/percentenrollment.html"> chart</a> with Chartbuilder to show enrollment trends from 2006-15.</p>
<p>Tableau proved to be an extremely helpful tool this past semester. I used the application to make a wide variety of visualizations, including this <a href="jessicahicks.github.io/arrests.html">interactive barchart</a> to show arrests on local college campuses.</p>
<p>I realized the importance of illustration in communication, and created a comic using Pixton to introduce myself in a creative way.</p>
